1. Take a moment to create a README for the chipseq_workshop/ folder (hint: use vim to create the file). Give a short description of the project and brief descriptions of the types of files you will be storing within each of the sub-directories.

```bash
## README ##
## This directory contains data generated during the Introduction to ChIP-seq workshop
## Date: September 21st, 2021

There are six subdirectories in this directory:

* raw_data : contains raw data FASTQ files used in the analysis
* meta:  contains any files pertaining to information about the individual samples
* logs: contains files containing log files generated by tools in the workflow. Files will contain a prefix/suffix to inidicate which tool/analysis it pertains to.
* results: contains subdirectories named by each step/tool applied in the ChIP-seq workflow
* scripts: all script files created to run analyses
* reference_data: includes various reference BED files and/or indices required to run analyses

```
