## Qualitative assessment of peak enrichment

The quality of ChIP-seq experiments can be especially difficult to evaluate when little is known about the factor and its binding motif, as is the case with PRDM16. The methods for peak call quality assessment can be seperated into those that are quantitative (which we will not be covering in this workshop) and those that are qualitative. Qualitative methods typically include a **traditional site-inspection-based evaluation** using a genome viewer or the **exploration of  aggregated read density in selected regions** using profile plots and heatmaps. When applied and interpreted together, these approaches provide a valuable overall assessment of experimental success and data quality. In this lesson, we will cover the latter of the qualitative approaches mentioned above.

> **NOTE:** The ENCODE Consortium uses various metrics to assess [enrichment](https://www.encodeproject.org/data-standards/terms/#enrichment) and [complexity](https://www.encodeproject.org/data-standards/terms/#library) aspects of ChIP-seq quality, however these quanitative measures are outside of the scope of this workshop and will not be covered.

## Profile plots
We will be generating profile plots to evaluate enrichment in our samples and try and decipher the nature of PRDM16 binding in cortical neurons. The profile plot allows us to **evaluate read density over sets of genomic regions**. Typically, these regions are genes (start and end coordinates), but any other regions defined in the BED file will work. 

We will be using the `plotProfile` command that is part of the [deepTools suite](https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/content/tools/plotProfile.html), to create our profile plots. To use this, a matrix generated by `computeMatrix` is required. You will need to **create a matrix for every new plot you generate**, so this step of the workflow can often take some time. In this lesson, we teach you how to create a matrix for the first figure, and then we provide the pre-computed matrices for you to use to save time.

> *NOTE:* The matrix we generate can also be used as input to [`plotHeatmap`](https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/content/tools/plotHeatmap.html?highlight=plotheatmap). Heatmaps are also a very popular data visualization option for peak call data. We will not be plotting heatmaps in this lesson, but encourage you to explore the command and the numerous parameters available for optimization.

### Setting up 

> _NOTE:_ If you have just completed the last lesson on creating bigWig files, you may already have yourself setup!

To get started you will need to be on a **compute node** and ensure you have an interactive session with **6 cores and 10G of memory**. The `computeMatrix` command can take some time, so we want to take advantage of the multi-threading. 

```bash
srun --pty -p interactive -t 0-5:00 -c 6 --mem 8G /bin/bash
```

Once you are on a compute node, load the modules:

```bash
$ module load gcc/6.2.0 python/2.7.12 deeptools/3.0.2 
```

Finally, we will move into our results directory and copy over the necessary bigWig files:

```bash
$ cd ~/chipseq_workshop/results/

$ cp /n/groups/hbctraining/harwell-datasets/workshop_material/results/visualization/bigWig/*chip.bw visualization/bigWig/
```

## Assessing read density between replicates

We have already shown that for our WT samples there are a good number of overlapping regions. Using `bedtools` we were able to extract a bed file of those consensus peaks. The next question is, **what kind of signal is observed for each replicate across these shared regions?**

The first step in creating the profile plot is to create the matrix. The `computeMatrix` command accepts multiple bigWig files and multiple region files (BED format) to create a count matrix. The command can also filter and sort regions according to their scores. For each window, `computeMatrix` will calculate scores based on the read density values in the bigWig files.

Below we describe the **parameters** we will be using:

* `reference-point`: The reference point for plotting. Here, we use the center of the consensus peaks (default is TSS).
* `-b`, `a`: Specify a window around the reference point (before and after). We have used +/- 4000 bp. 
* `-R`: The region file will be the BED file we generated for WT replicate overlap.
* `-S`: The list of bigWig files (WT replicates), that we have generated for you.
* `--skipZeros`: Do not incude regions with only scores of zero
* `-o`: output file name
* `-p`: number of cores


Let's create a matrix for the WT replicates:

```bash
computeMatrix reference-point --referencePoint center \
-b 4000 -a 4000 \
-R ~/chipseq_workshop/results/macs2/wt_peaks_final.bed \
-S visualization/bigWig/wt_sample2_chip.bw visualization/bigWig/wt_sample2_chip.bw \
--skipZeros \
-o ~/chipseq_workshop/results/visualization/wt_matrix.gz \
-p 6
```
> _Runtime estimate: 8-10 minutes_

Once you have computed the matrix, you can create the **profile plot**. First, make a directory designated for the figures we will be creating, and then we will run `plotProfile`. _The `plotProfile` command will take a shorter amount of time to run._ 

> **NOTE:** `plotProfile` has many options to optimize your figure, including the ability to change the type of lines plotted, and to plot by group rather than sample. We encourage you to explore the [documentation](https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/content/tools/plotProfile.html?highlight=plotProfile) to find out more detail.

```bash

# Create figures directory under visualization
mkdir ~/chipseq_workshop/results/visualization/figures

# Plot the profiles
plotProfile -m ~/chipseq_workshop/results/visualization/wt_matrix.gz \
-out ~/chipseq_workshop/results/visualization/figures/plot1_wt_replciates.png \
--regionsLabel "" \
--perGroup \
--colors red blue \
--samplesLabel "WT_replicate1" "WT_replicate2" \
--refPointLabel "PRDM16 binding sites"

```

> **NOTE:** The output of `plotProfile` will be a PNG image file, which you **will not be able to open on the cluster**. To view the file you will want to use [FileZilla](03_QC_FASTQC.md#what-is-filezilla) to move it over to your local computer. 

The figure should like the one displayed below. We observe that the **replicate 2 has a much higher signal** present in these regions. This is not uncommon in ChIP-seq data. What is encouraging to see is that there is a **decent amount of signal in both replicates**, so we have some confidence in the regions we identified.

**Exercise: Assessing loss of signal in the KO samples**

The KO samples in the dataset represent two separate pools of E15.5 Prdm16 conditional knockout cortices. It would be good to **evaluate PRDM binding sites** in samples where the PRDM16 is rendered non-functional, and **see how read density compares to the WT**.

1. Modify the `computeMatrix` command we previously used so the input bigWigs are now `wt_sample2_chip.bw` and `ko_sample2_chip.bw`. You will also want to change the name of the ouput file to `wt_ko_matrix.gz`.
2. Compute the matrix.
3. Draw the profile plot. Be sure to modify the `--samplesLabel`.
4. Comment on the plot.

  --refPointLabel "PRDM16 binding sites"
  ```
  
We observed that the WT sample shows significantly higher enrichment at PRDM16-binding regions, compared to the KO sample. The result matches our expectation.

## Evaluating enrichment around the TSS

Because many cis-regulatory elements (i.e. promoters, enhancers, and silencers) are close to transcription start site (TSS) of their targets, **a common visualization** technique is to evaluate the aggregated **read density around the TSS**. 

To create this profile plot, we will need to compute yet another matrix. For this plot, we will need to change the following parameters:

* `-R`: Our regions file will change. Rather than using our PRDM16 binding sites, we will use a BED file which contains the start and end coordinate for every genes in the mm10 genome.
* `reference-point`: The reference point will be TSS. Specifying this means that the window will be centered around the start coordinate of each region.
* `-S`: The bigWig files input will be similar to the first plot we created, pointing to the two WT ChIP samples.

> **NOTE**: The mm10 genes BED file was obtained from the [UCSC table browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables).


**Since this matrix takes especially long to compute, we have created it for you**. Copy over the matrix into your `visualization` directory:

```bash
cp /n/groups/hbctraining/harwell-datasets/workshop_material/results/visualization/wt_matrix_allGenes_TSS.gz visualization/
```

_The code to compute the matrix is provided in the drop-down below if you are interested in seeing the changes that were made. Please DO NOT RUN!_

<details>
  <summary>Code</summary>
  
  ```bash
  # DO NOT RUN!
  computeMatrix reference-point --referencePoint TSS \
  -b 4000 -a 4000 \
  -R /n/groups/hbctraining/harwell-datasets/chipseq_workshop/reference/mm10-allknownGenes.bed \
  -S visualization/bigWig/wt_sample1_chip.bw visualization/bigWig/wt_sample2_chip.bw \
  --skipZeros \
  -o visualization/wt_tss_matrix.gz \
  -p 6
  
  ```
</details>

Use the matrix to create your own profile plot by running the code below. Once complete, copy your PNG file over to your local computer to open it up.

```bash
plotProfile command
```
> *NOTE*: We added an additional parameter to set the y-axis similar to the previous plots. (add more info here..) In this way we can make a more fair comparison between plot.

Yikes! This is not what we were expecting. **There appears to be very little enrichment in the +/- 4kb window around the TSS.** How do we interpret this?

</p>

It is disappointing to see something like this if you are investigating a transcription factor known to bind at promoter regions of genes. But that is not the case for us. PRDM16 binding is an unknown to us. 

### So where is PRDM16 binding? Can we still consider it a transcription factor?
While some some transcription factors bind to promoter regions, other transcription factors bind to regulatory sequences, such as **enhancer sequences**, and can either stimulate or repress transcription of the related gene. These regulatory sequences **can be thousands of base pairs upstream or downstream from the gene being transcribed**. 

> **NOTE**: Later in the ChIP-seq workflow (not covered in this workshop), we use software to annotate our peaks using nearest gene approaches. This can give us more detailed information on where the PRDM16 binding sites are located.


## Exploring PRDM16-regulated enhancer binding in cortical neurons

Now that we have learned that very few sites bind to the promoter regions of genes, our next hypothesis is that **PRDM16 is binding to enhancer regions**. One way of assessing this is to obtain a BED file of regions that correspond to [enhancer regions in mouse genome](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=mm10&c=chrX&g=encode3RenEnhancerEpdNewPromoter). While this is a totally valid avenue to explore, we will be taking another route in this workshop.

Early in the workshop we described the [ENCODE](https://www.encodeproject.org/) resource to you, and now we want to show you how to make use of it to interrogate your data.

After plotting the binding pattern for PRDM16, we then ask: how does PRDM16 regulates the gene expression? Let's explore one of the possibilities here: histone methylation. Histone methylation could up-regulate or down-regulate the gene expression, depending on the position of methylation. We could analyze the overlap of PRDM16-binding regions with different histone methylation marks (H3K4me, H3K4me3, H3K27me3), and speculate the mechanism of regulation accordingly. The data for the histone methylation level could be obtained from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements ([ENCODE](https://www.encodeproject.org/)), which we have put in our training directory (`/n/groups/hbctraining/harwell-datasets/encode-chipseq/`). To fasten the computing process, we could submit a running job, instead of running on an interactive node. Create a sbatch script as below (with the name `plot2.sbatch`, and then run the script using `sbatch plot2.sbatch` command.

```bash
#!/bin/sh

#SBATCH -p priority
#SBATCH -c 2
#SBATCH -t 0-1:00
#SBATCH --mem 16G

computeMatrix reference-point --referencePoint center \
-b 4000 -a 4000 \
-R ~/chipseq_workshop/results/macs2/wt_peaks_final.bed \
-S ~/chipseq_workshop/results/visualization/bigWig/wt_sample2_chip.bw /n/groups/hbctraining/harwell-datasets/encode-chipseq/H3k04me1UE14_mm10.bw /n/groups/hbctraining/harwell-datasets/encode-chipseq/H3k04me3UE14_mm10.bw /n/groups/hbctraining/harwell-datasets/encode-chipseq/H3k27me3UE14_mm10.bw \
--skipZeros \
-o ~/chipseq_workshop/results/visualization/wt_encode_matrix.gz \
-p 6

plotProfile -m ~/chipseq_workshop/results/visualization/wt_encode_matrix.gz \
-out ~/chipseq_workshop/results/visualization/figures/plot2_wt_encode.png \
--regionsLabel "" \
--perGroup \
--colors blue green red orange \
--samplesLabel "PRDM16" "H3K4me" "H3K4me3" "H3K27me3" \
--refPointLabel "PRDM16 binding sites"
```

We observed some moderate levels of H3K4me3 and H3K4me in PRDM16-binding regions. The result makes sense, because both H3K4me3 and H3K4me are associated with transcriptional activation. Not surprisingly, H3K27me3 shares little overlap in PRDM16-binding regions, as H3K27me3 is a epigenetic modification associated with transcriptional repression during neurogenesis, and we do not expect transcriptional repression.
